  author    = "Taylor, Michael E",
  editor    = "Taylor, Michael E",
  abstract  = "In this preliminary chapter we give an outline of the theory of
               pseudodifferential operators as it has been developed to treat
               problems in linear PDE, and which will provide a basis for
               further developments to be discussed in the following chapters.
               Many results will be proved in detail, but some proofs are only
               sketched, with references to more details in the literature. We
               define pseudodifferential operators with symbols in
               H{\"o}rmander's classes Sp,$\delta$m, derive some useful
               properties of their Schwartz kernels, discuss their algebraic
               properties, then show how they can be used to establish
               regularity of solutions to elliptic PDE with smooth
               coefficients. We proceed to a discussion of mapping properties
               on L2 and on the Sobolev spaces Hs, then discuss G{\aa}rding's
               inequality, and some of its refinements, known as sharp
               G{\aa}rding inequalities. In §0.8 we apply some of the previous
               material to establish existence of solutions to hyperbolic
               equations. We introduce the notion of wave front set in §0.10
               and discuss microlocal regularity of solutions to elliptic
               equations. We also discuss how solution operators to a class of
               hyperbolic equations propagate wave front sets. In §0.11 we
               discuss Lpestimates, particularly some fundamental results of
               Calderon and Zygmund, and applications to Littlewood-Paley
               Theory, which will be an important technical tool for basic
               estimates established in Chapter 2.We end this introduction with
               a brief discussion of pseudodifferential operators on manifolds.",

               uate course on Riemannian geometry, for students who are
               familiar with topological and di?erentiable manifolds. It
               focuses on developing an in- mate acquaintance with the
               geometric meaning of curvature. In so doing, it introduces and
               demonstrates the uses of all the main technical tools needed for
               a careful study of Riemannian manifolds. I have selected a set
               of topics that can reasonably be covered in ten to ?fteen weeks,
               instead of making any attempt to provide an encyclopedic
               treatment of the subject. The book begins with a careful
               treatment of the
               machineryofmetrics,connections,andgeodesics,withoutwhichonecannot
               claim to be doing Riemannian geometry. It then introduces the
               Riemann curvature tensor, and quickly moves on to submanifold
               theory in order to give the curvature tensor a concrete
               quantitative interpretation. From then on, all e?orts are bent
               toward proving the four most fundamental theorems relating
               curvature and topology: the Gauss--Bonnet theorem (expressing
               thetotalcurvatureofasurfaceintermsofitstopologicaltype),theCartan--
               Hadamard theorem (restricting the topology of manifolds of
               nonpositive curvature), Bonnet's theorem (giving analogous
               restrictions on manifolds of strictly positive curvature), and a
               special case of the Cartan--Ambrose-- Hicks theorem
               (characterizing manifolds of constant curvature). Many other
               results and techniques might reasonably claim a place in an
               introductory Riemannian geometry course, but could not be
               included due to time constraints.",

               VII of my 1963 book ``Linear partial differential operators''.
               In addition there is an entirely new chapter on convolution
               equations, one on scattering theory, and one on methods from the
               theory of analytic functions of several complex variables. The
               latter is somewhat limited in scope though since it seems
               superfluous to duplicate the monographs by Eh renpreis and by
               Palamodov on this subject. The reader is assumed to be familiar
               with distribution theory as presented in Volume I. Most topics
               discussed here have in fact been encountered in Volume I in
               special cases, which should provide the necessary motivation and
               background for a more systematic and pre cise exposition. The
               main technical tool in this volume is the Fourier- Laplace
               transformation. More powerful methods for the study of operators
               with variable coefficients will be developed in Volume III.
               However, the constant coefficient theory has given the guidehnes
               for all that work. Although the field is no longer very active -
               perhaps because of its advanced state of development - and
               although it is pos sible to pass directly from Volume I to

  abstract  = "In 1963 my book entitled ``Linear partial differential
               operators'' was published in the Grundlehren series. Some parts
               of it have aged well but others have been made obsolete for
               quite some time by techniques using pseudo-differential and
               Fourier integral operators. The rapid development has made it
               difficult to bring the book up to date. However, the new methods
               seem to have matured enough now to make an attempt worth while.
               The progress in the theory of linear partial differential
               equations during the past 30 years owes much to the theory of
               distributions created by Laurent Schwartz at the end of the
               1940's. It summed up a great deal of the experience accumulated
               in the study of partial differential equations up to that time,
               and it has provided an ideal frame work for later developments.
               ``Linear partial differential operators'' began with a brief
               summary of distribution theory for this was still unfamiliar to
               many analysts 20 years ago. The presentation then proceeded
               directly to the most general results available on partial
               differential operators. Thus the reader was expected to have
               some prior familiarity with the classical theory although it was
               not appealed to explicitly. Today it may no longer be necessary
               to include basic distribution theory but it does not seem
               reasonable to assume a classical background in the theory of
               partial differential equations since modern treatments are rare.",
