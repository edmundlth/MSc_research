\chapter{Introduction}
 It is well known in Fourier analysis that the rate of decay of the Fourier transform of a distribution is a measure of smoothness of the distribution. Microlocal analysis, first introduced by Sato \cite{} and Hormander \cite{}, is the study of distributions that takes advantage of this observation by keeping track of not only the singular points in the base manifold, but also the \textit{directions} in the cotangent bundle in which the Fourier transform has insufficient decay. \\
\\
Pseudifferential operators are the central object of study in microlocal analysis. They generalise traditional differential operators with smooth coefficients. The theory of pseudodifferential operators provides insights into the study of linear partial differential equations$  $. For instance, the theory provides techniques to prove that certain differential operators are \textit{Fredholm} as linear maps between appropriate Sobolev spaces. The property of an operator being Fredholm reduces the question of solvability to checking a finite number of conditions and restricts the non-uniqueness of any solution to a finite dimensional space (see \cite{}). While traditionally only elliptic operators are associated with Fredholm problems, there has been recent fruitful application of results from microlocal analysis, particularly the propagation of singularities estimates \ref{}, to the study of non-elliptic Fredholm problems \cite{}. \\

\begin{description}
    \item[Chapter 2 :] Beside fixing notations that will be used throughout the paper, this chapter serves to introduce functional analysis concepts and theorems that are central to microlocal analysis. In particular, the space of Schwartz functions, tempered distributions and their relationship with the Fourier transform are introduced. Several results concerning compact and Fredholm operators between Banach spaces will also be stated in preparation for chapter 5. 
    
    \item[Chapter 3 :] Here we will define and prove various topological and algebraic properties of pseudodifferential operators. 
    
    \item[Chapter 4: ] We will then turn our attention to pseudodifferential equations, i.e. equations of the form $Au = f$ with $A$ being a pseudodifferential operator, $u$ the unknown and $f$ a given distribution. Of particular importance is when $A$ is an \textit{elliptic} operator which allow us to invert $A$ up to ``trivial" terms. For each operator $A$, we will wish to answer the question : ``How does the presence of singularities in $f$ affect the regularity of the solution $u$?" 
    
    \item[Chapter 5: ] Here we will consider the Fredholm problem of the totally periodic wave operator on the $n + 1$-torus. We will see the application of the propagation of singularities theorem to construct subspaces of the Sobolev spaces on the torus on which the wave operator acts as a Fredholm operator after some pertubation.
